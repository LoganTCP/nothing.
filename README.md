 Just nothing.

# Build Requirements
-  **Unity Hub** - The project manager for Unity projects.
-  **Unity Editor 2020.3.48f1** - The Editor for Unity projects.
-  **Build Modules** - Any modules you plan to build with (Ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, WebGL, etc.). See, [Add modules to the Unity Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddModules.html), for instructions.

# How to Build
 #### 1. Clone the repo
-  CD to the directory of your choice. ```cd path/to/project```
-  Clone to your current directory. ```git clone https://github.com/LoganTCP/nothing..git``` (Note: you may have to rename the cloned folder to remove the ```.``` otherwise, the project will not open).

 #### 2. Open in Unity 2020.3.48f1
-  Open Unity Hub and make sure you have ```Unity 2020.3.48f1``` installed.
-  Click ```Add``` in the top-right corner of the window.
-  Navigate to the cloned repo and open it.

 #### 3. Build!
-  Click ```File > Build Settings``` in the toolbar of the Unity Editor.
-  Choose a platform to build with (This platform must be installed as a Module in the editor version listed in Unity Hub).
-  After changing any settings, click ```Switch Platform``` (This may take a while... If it is already on the platform you want, this step can be skipped).
-  Once that is finished, click ```Build```, choose a directory to save the build to, and go grab a coffee!
-  Once the previous step is done, you should be able to run this build! Congrats!
